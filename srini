Subject: Clarification on Graphs and Monitoring in Zabbix

Dear Srini and Team,

As discussed, there is no issue with the graph and monitoring of the server using Zabbix. However, I’d like to clarify how the graphs are organized and accessed for better understanding:

1. Graph Sections in Zabbix:
When navigating to Zabbix for a specific server, you will find two sections for graphs:

Highlighted Graph Section: This section allows you to view graphical data based on your selected time range.

Other Graph Section: This displays a different category of graphs created for the server. However, the section highlighted by you shows an inaccessible template graph, which is only accessible to Zabbix super admins.



2. Ways to Check Graphs:

Via Latest Data: Navigate to the “Latest Data” section, select the required parameter, and click on the corresponding graph.

Graph Section on the Monitored Server: Use this section to view all available graphs categorized for the server.




Please review these methods and let us know if you require any additional information or assistance.

Best regards,
Amit Kumar Nayak
