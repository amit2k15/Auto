The primary reason for my decision to explore new opportunities is the lack of a clear technical and career growth path over the past several months. There has been minimal meaningful work, no new initiatives, and no structured plans. Over the past five years, I have dedicated significant effort and focus to deploying an open-source tool that has successfully onboarded approximately 150 applications. We implemented extensive automation and self-healing capabilities through this tool, significantly improving operational efficiency.

However, the current leadership has chosen not to take ownership of the technical responsibilities and has decided to transition the tool and its maintenance to a different team. This decision not only disregards the work we've done but also puts at risk the value created by our teamâ€™s contributions. As a result, I feel that my efforts are no longer aligned with the organization's direction, prompting me to seek a role where my technical skills and initiatives will be better utilized and appreciated.
