Hi Ankur,

I hope you have received the required details you requested, except for A and B. Please review and let us know if you need anything else.

Additionally, please update us on when and how we should plan the migration of the ORx Stage Zabbix instance to Enterprise.

As suggested by Chrissy, let me know if I should schedule a meeting with Genoa or if we need to wait for further updates.

Looking forward to your response.
