Hi Sheryl,

As you know, our leadership is planning to migrate ORx Zabbix to the Enterprise Zabbix team. As part of this initiative, the Enterprise team is looking for information on Zabbix agent integration with AppStore, specifically the contact details of the AppStore team we previously worked with.

Due to company policy, I no longer have access to the old email conversations after three months. Could you please check if you have any backup of those conversations or any other relevant information that could help the Enterprise team move forward?

Your support on this would be greatly appreciated.
