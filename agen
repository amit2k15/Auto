Dear [Manager's Name],

As I had informed earlier, I fell down the stairs at my home two days ago and sustained an injury to my left leg. Following a doctor's consultation, I underwent an X-ray, which revealed a small crack in my left ankle. The doctor has prescribed medication and advised complete bed rest for the next 2 to 3 months.

I have attached the medical prescription for your reference. Given the situation, I kindly request approval to work from home for the recommended recovery period. Please let me know if any further information is required.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
