Hi Team,

I have cross-verified the alerts triggered due to the Zabbix agent being unavailable for more than 3 minutes. Upon reviewing the status, I observed that the Zabbix agent availability has been fluctuating over the past 24 hours.

I have attached a screenshot showing the agent status over the last 7 days, where we can see the issue started from yesterday. Could you please check on the server side if any changes were made that might be causing this?

To avoid multiple alerts, I am temporarily disabling alerting on the Zabbix agent until we identify the root cause. Let me know if you need any further details.
