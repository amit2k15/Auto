Dear Team,

A few days ago, we received a request from Kedar to modify the query. Post-modification, we have observed the following:

For most of the sites, the query is returning 0.
For RG, the query is returning No data.
To provide clarity, I have attached screenshots showing the results of both the old and modified queries for the last 10 minutes of data.

Please note that there are no issues identified with Grafana.

Let me know if further details are required or if any additional steps are needed.

Best regards,
Amit Kumar Nayak
