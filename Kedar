Hi [Recipient's Name],

The Pharmacy team is still conducting the weekly monitoring meeting for all monitoring teams, along with the SLOs of each application, every Wednesday. Sheryl is also part of this meeting.

Additionally, Kedar scheduled a separate meeting and invited the Enterprise team to discuss a few action items, during which we also discussed the Nonuser IDs.

As of today, all SMEs from our team continue to join the weekly monitoring call scheduled by Kedar.

Let me know if you need any further details.
