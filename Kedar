I have cross-verified the alerts triggered from Zabbix for OWCA. As informed, there is an ongoing outage in the ELR Datacenter, which has impacted multiple applications, including Zabbix.

I have identified that a few OWCA Zabbix proxies are affected as they are hosted in ELR DC. Since ICMP monitoring depends on the ping from the Zabbix proxy to OWCA servers, we are currently observing latency issues and SSH timeout errors while trying to log in to the Zabbix proxy to manually check the ping.

Please let me know if you need any further details.
