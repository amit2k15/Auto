Subject: Update on Vulnerability Remediation Progress

Dear Michael,

Thank you for your follow-up. Iâ€™d like to provide you with an update on the vulnerability remediation progress:

Total vulnerabilities identified: 87

Vulnerabilities fixed so far: 53

Remaining vulnerabilities: 34

Out of the 34 remaining vulnerabilities, 6 vulnerabilities are present on the DB servers, for which we do not have direct access. We have already informed the DB team about these vulnerabilities, and they have acknowledged the issue. They will review and provide us with an update once they have further information.
